This project is a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and machine learning techniques. It analyzes movie metadata and user preferences to generate personalized movie suggestions. The system uses content-based filtering with similarity metrics to recommend movies similar to those the user already enjoys.

The repository includes:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering in a Jupyter Notebook (movie_reco_system.ipynb)

A deployable Python app (app.py) for generating real-time recommendations

Machine learning pipeline built using vectorization, cosine similarity, and metadata extraction

This project demonstrates skills in Python, data analysis, machine learning, and building end-to-end recommendation systems.
